### Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know
1. **Sort Algorithins:** Sorting is the one of most heavily studied concepts in Computer Science. Idea is to arrange the items of a list in a specific order. Though every major programming language has built-in sorting libraries, it comes in handy if you know how they work. *[Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bucket Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Insertion Sort]*
2. **Search Algorithms:** This is another important category of algorithms which are essential for many real-world applications. There is fewer algorithms here, compare to sorting ones. *[Linear search, Binary Search, Depth First Search(DFS), Breadth First Search(BFS)]*
3. **Hashing:** Hash lookup is currently the most widely used technique to find appropriate data by key or ID. We access data by its index. *[Hash Map, Hash Table, Dictionary]*
4. **Dynamic Programming:** Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems. We solve the subproblems, remember their results and using them we make our way to solve the complex problem, quickly. *[Duckworth-Lewis method, Floyd's All-Pairs shortest path algorithm]*
5. **String Matching & Parsing:** Pattern matching/searching is one of the most important problem in Computer Science. There have been a lot of research on the topic. *[KMP Algorithm (String Matching), Regular Expression (String Parsing)]*

### Most Popular Programming Paradigms
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (00P):** Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as properties; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.
2. **Functional Programming:**  Functional programming is a programming paradigm of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
3. **Structured Programming:** Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection and repetition, block structures and subroutines.
4. **Procedural Programming:** Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
5. **Imperative Programming:** Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.
6. **Declarative Programming:** Declarative programming is a programming paradigm of building the structure and elements of computer programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
7. **Event-driven Programming:** Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.
8. **Aspect-oriented Programming:** Aspect-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.

### Subjects Software Developers Should Know
1. **Object Oriented Analysis & Design:** For better maintainability, reusability and faster development, the most well accepted approach, shortly GOAD and its SOLID principals are very important for software development.
2. **Design Patterns:** Design patterns are standard and most effective solutions for specific problems. If you don't want to reinvent the wheel, you should learn them.
3. **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Data structures like array, list, stack, tree and useful algorithms are vital for software development.
4. **Operating Systems Basics:** By learning OS basics, we can have better vision, viewpoints and performance for your applications.
5. **Network Basics:** Network is related to computer organization, OS and the whole information transfer process. In some cases you'll face it in the development cycle. So, it's important to learn network basics.
6. **Software Testing:** Testing is an important part of software engineering. Unit testing, its best practices and techniques like black box, white box, mocking, TDD and integration testing are subjects whic must be known.
7. **Version Control System:** VCS tools are very important by saving so much time for collaborative works and versioning.

### How to Write Clean & Maintainable Code
1. **YAGNI:** You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI) is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.
2. **DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
3. **KISS:** Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) as a design principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design, and that unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
4. **Commenting:** Writing useful and necessary comments will help your code to be more clean.

### Data Structures Basics
Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently. Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way.
1. **Built-in Data Type:** Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. For example, most of the languages provide the following built-in data types. *[Integers, Boolean (true, false), Floating (Decimal numbers), Character and Strings]*
2. **Derived Data Type:** Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. *[Array, List, Stack, Queue]*
3. **Array:** Array is a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type. Most of the data structures make use of arrays to implement their algorithms.

  Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element. Index starts with 0.
4. **Linked List:** A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links. Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the various types of linked list: *[Simple Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List ]*
5. **Stack:** A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. *[LIFO  (Last-in-first-out) or FILO  (First-in-last-out)]*
6. **Queue:** Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue) *[LILO (Last in Last out) or FIFO (First in First out)]*

### Core Functional Programming Concepts
1. **Functions are Pure!:** functions are pure in the sense that they abide by two restrictions:
    1. A function called multiple times with the same arguments will always return the same value.
    2. No side effects occult. throughout the function's execution.
2. **Variables are Immutable!:** In functional programming, you can't modify a variable after it's been initialized.
3. **Functions have Referential Trancparency!:** If you can replace the value of a function call with its return Value everywhere that it's called and the state of the program stays the same, then the function is referentially transparent.
4. **Functions are First-Class & can be Higher-Order:** For a function to be first-class, you just have to be able to set it to a variable.
Higher-order functions build off of this concept of "functions as first-class citizens" and are defined as functions that either accept another function as an argument, or that return a function themselves.
5. **Functional Programming is Based on Lambda Calculus:** Functional programming is heavily rooted in a mathematical system called lambda calculus. Two core concepts of lambda calculus that really shaped the structure of how factional programming works:
    1. In lambda calculus, all functions can be
    written anonymously without a name
    2. When invoked, all functions will go through a process called currying

### Basic Concepts of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
1. **Class:** The class is a model or blueprint or prototype of an object that defines or specifies all the properties & behavior of the objects.
2. **Abstraction:** Abstraction means hiding the implementation and showing only functionality to the user.
3. **Object:** An object is an entity or instance of a class. Each object has properties and behaviors.
4. **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the process of binding the data by making it private and functions to process that data into a single unit.
5. **Inheritance:** Inheritance is the process of acquiring or sharing the properties and behaviors of the base class into the sub class to achieve reusability.
6. **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism refers to the ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.

### Ways to stay motivated while learning to code
1. **Starts Small!** - Learning code can be a daunting task to many, but one of the most helpful ways to learn and stay engaged it is to start small.
2. **Celebrate the Little Things!** - Learning to code gives you the tools to build things that can potentially change the world. Build things, test what you learned, and keep going at it.
3. **Get a Mentor!** - Having a mentor means avoiding those common mistakes and roadblocks that slow down your learning process. Mentors have all ''been there, done that'' and can provide valuable advice and motivation derived from their real-world experience.
4. **Maintain a Portfolio!** - Once you've built more and more things, keep a collection of your work. Whenever you're feeling a lack of motivation, you can always refer to this and see how far you've come.
5. **Just Do It!** - Sometimes, you just have to stop over-thinking and over-complicating things and just do it.
Simple and Powerful: Do It!
6. **Have a Balanced Life!** - Sometimes it's easy to forget that there's a world outside of your computer, so make sure that you're consistently taking a break away from your computer!

### Top Most Dangerous Programming mistakes
1. **Improper Input Validation** - Ensure that your input is valid. If you're expecting a number, it shouldn't contain letters.
2. **Failure to Preserve SQL Query Structure (SQL Injection)** -  If attackers can influence the SQL that you send to your database, they can modify the queries to steal, corrupt, or otherwise change your underlying data.
3. **Failure to Preserve WebPage Structure (Cross-site Scripting)** - Cross-site scripting(XSS) is a result of combining the stateless nature of HTTP, the mixture of data and script in HTML, lots of data passing between web sites, diverse encoding schemes, and feature-rich web browsers.
4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery** - Cross-site request forgery is like accepting a package from a stranger except the attacker tricks a user into activating a HTTP request "package" that goes to your site.
5. **Error Message Information Leak** - Chatty error messages can disclose secrets to any attacker who misuses your software.
6. **Failure to Control Generation of Code (Code Injection)** - It becomes a serious vulnerability when your code is directly callable by unauthorized parties.
7. **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm** - Cryptography is not easy. Grow-your-own cryptography is a welcome sight to attackers.
8. **Download of Code Without Integrity Check** - If you download code and execute it, you're trusting that the source of that code isn't malicious. But attackers can modify that code before it reaches you.

### Software Developer Job Interview tips
1. **Create Professional Resume** - Writing an organized and appealing resume can significantly increase your chances of success. Consider hiring an expert to create an outstanding resume for you!
2. **Build Related Experience** - Developers starting out or moving from another career field, lack relevant work experience and have no idea how to get it. There are many ways you can get experience that will look good on your resume and give employers confidence in hiring you, you just may have to be a little creative.
3. **Learn To Solve Algorithm-Based Problems** - It is an important skill that every developer should have and it isn't really that difficult to learn. Many tech job interviews include one or more questions where you are asked to solve some programming problem, either on a whiteboard or at a computer.
4. **Answer Questions with Passion** - Showing your passion to the interviewer while answering their questions is a great opportunity for you to look more impressive.
5. **Don't Ever Lie** - One of the worst things to do in an interview is to lie. If you don't know something, don't make up an answer. Don't pretend like you worked with some technology if you haven't or make up some story of how you used something in your last job.
6. **Know Your Computer Science Basics** - You don't have to be a computer science professor, but you should at least know the basics. These concepts indicate that you have strong foundational knowledge in programming!

### Popular Software Development Methodologies
1. **Waterfall Methodology** - The waterfall model is a popular version of the systems development life cycle model for software engineering. Often considered the classic approach to the systems development life cycle, the waterfall model describes a development method that is rigid and linear.
2. **Spiral Methodology** - The spiral lifecycle model is a sophisticated lifecycle model that focuses on early identification and reduction of project risks. A spiral project start on a small scale, explores risks, makes a plan to handle the risks, and then decides whether to take the next step of the project.
3. **Rapid Application Development (RAD) Methodology** - Rapid-development language is a general term that refers to any programming language that offers speedier implementation than do traditional third-generation languages such as C/C++, Pascal, or Fortran.
4. **Extreme Programming (XP) Methodology** - XP is a methodology for creating software within a very unstable environment. It allows flexibility within the modeling process. The main goal of XP is to lower the cost of change in a software requirements.
5. **Agile Software Development Methodology** - Agile software development is a conceptual framework for undertaking software engineering projects. There are a number of agile software development methodologies e.g. Crystal Methods, Dynamic Systems Development Model (DSDM), and Scrum.
6. **Scrum Methodology** - Scrum is an agile method for project management developed by Ken Schwaber. Its goal is to dramatically improve productivity in teams previously paralyzed by heavier, process-laden methodologies.
