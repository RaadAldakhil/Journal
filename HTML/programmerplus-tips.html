<h3 id="waystostaymotivatedwhilelearningtocode">Ways to stay motivated while learning to code</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Starts Small!</strong> - Learning code can be a daunting task to many, but one of the most helpful ways to learn and stay engaged it is to start small.</li>

<li><strong>Celebrate the Little Things!</strong> - Learning to code gives you the tools to build things that can potentially change the world. Build things, test what you learned, and keep going at it.</li>

<li><strong>Get a Mentor!</strong> - Having a mentor means avoiding those common mistakes and roadblocks that slow down your learning process. Mentors have all ''been there, done that'' and can provide valuable advice and motivation derived from their real-world experience.</li>

<li><strong>Maintain a Portfolio!</strong> - Once you've built more and more things, keep a collection of your work. Whenever you're feeling a lack of motivation, you can always refer to this and see how far you've come.</li>

<li><strong>Just Do It!</strong> - Sometimes, you just have to stop over-thinking and over-complicating things and just do it.
Simple and Powerful: Do It!</li>

<li><strong>Have a Balanced Life!</strong> - Sometimes it's easy to forget that there's a world outside of your computer, so make sure that you're consistently taking a break away from your computer!</li>

<h3 id="topmostdangerousprogrammingmistakes">Top Most Dangerous Programming mistakes</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Improper Input Validation</strong> - Ensure that your input is valid. If you're expecting a number, it shouldn't contain letters.</li>

<li><strong>Failure to Preserve SQL Query Structure (SQL Injection)</strong> -  If attackers can influence the SQL that you send to your database, they can modify the queries to steal, corrupt, or otherwise change your underlying data.</li>

<li><strong>Failure to Preserve WebPage Structure (Cross-site Scripting)</strong> - Cross-site scripting(XSS) is a result of combining the stateless nature of HTTP, the mixture of data and script in HTML, lots of data passing between web sites, diverse encoding schemes, and feature-rich web browsers.</li>

<li><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery</strong> - Cross-site request forgery is like accepting a package from a stranger except the attacker tricks a user into activating a HTTP request "package" that goes to your site.</li>

<li><strong>Error Message Information Leak</strong> - Chatty error messages can disclose secrets to any attacker who misuses your software.</li>

<li><strong>Failure to Control Generation of Code (Code Injection)</strong> - It becomes a serious vulnerability when your code is directly callable by unauthorized parties.</li>

<li><strong>Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm</strong> - Cryptography is not easy. Grow-your-own cryptography is a welcome sight to attackers.</li>

<li><strong>Download of Code Without Integrity Check</strong> - If you download code and execute it, you're trusting that the source of that code isn't malicious. But attackers can modify that code before it reaches you.</li>

<h3 id="softwaredeveloperjobinterviewtips">Software Developer Job Interview tips</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Create Professional Resume</strong> - Writing an organized and appealing resume can significantly increase your chances of success. Consider hiring an expert to create an outstanding resume for you!</li>

<li><strong>Build Related Experience</strong> - Developers starting out or moving from another career field, lack relevant work experience and have no idea how to get it. There are many ways you can get experience that will look good on your resume and give employers confidence in hiring you, you just may have to be a little creative.</li>

<li><strong>Learn To Solve Algorithm-Based Problems</strong> - It is an important skill that every developer should have and it isn't really that difficult to learn. Many tech job interviews include one or more questions where you are asked to solve some programming problem, either on a whiteboard or at a computer.</li>

<li><strong>Answer Questions with Passion</strong> - Showing your passion to the interviewer while answering their questions is a great opportunity for you to look more impressive.</li>

<li><strong>Don't Ever Lie</strong> - One of the worst things to do in an interview is to lie. If you don't know something, don't make up an answer. Don't pretend like you worked with some technology if you haven't or make up some story of how you used something in your last job.</li>

<li><strong>Know Your Computer Science Basics</strong> - You don't have to be a computer science professor, but you should at least know the basics. These concepts indicate that you have strong foundational knowledge in programming!</li>

<h3 id="popularsoftwaredevelopmentmethodologies">Popular Software Development Methodologies</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Waterfall Methodology</strong> - The waterfall model is a popular version of the systems development life cycle model for software engineering. Often considered the classic approach to the systems development life cycle, the waterfall model describes a development method that is rigid and linear.</li>

<li><strong>Spiral Methodology</strong> - The spiral lifecycle model is a sophisticated lifecycle model that focuses on early identification and reduction of project risks. A spiral project start on a small scale, explores risks, makes a plan to handle the risks, and then decides whether to take the next step of the project.</li>

<li><strong>Rapid Application Development (RAD) Methodology</strong> - Rapid-development language is a general term that refers to any programming language that offers speedier implementation than do traditional third-generation languages such as C/C++, Pascal, or Fortran.</li>

<li><strong>Extreme Programming (XP) Methodology</strong> - XP is a methodology for creating software within a very unstable environment. It allows flexibility within the modeling process. The main goal of XP is to lower the cost of change in a software requirements.</li>

<li><strong>Agile Software Development Methodology</strong> - Agile software development is a conceptual framework for undertaking software engineering projects. There are a number of agile software development methodologies e.g. Crystal Methods, Dynamic Systems Development Model (DSDM), and Scrum.</li>

<li><strong>Scrum Methodology</strong> - Scrum is an agile method for project management developed by Ken Schwaber. Its goal is to dramatically improve productivity in teams previously paralyzed by heavier, process-laden methodologies.</li>
