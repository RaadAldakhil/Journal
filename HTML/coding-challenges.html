<h3 id="theory">Theory:</h3>

<ol>
<li>You are continuously flipping one coin. What series of flips is more likely to come up first: TTH, or THT?</li>

<li>Jason says: "If your are being mugged at the ATM, put your PIN in backwards to call the police!" From an ATM-programmer's perspective, could Jason be right? Why/why not?</li>

<li>Can you think of a number where adding 2 gives the same result as multiplying the number by itself? Can you think of another number with this exact same property?</li>

<li>Townsville has two barbers. Barber John is neat, clean shaven, and looks well groomed. Barber Jack looks dirty, messy, and dishevelled. Where do you go for a haircut?</li>

<li>In the country of Logicia, the number of cars is twice what the roads can handle. The President/king decrees that on even numbered days of the month, cars with even-numbered registration plates can drive, and odd-numbered cars on odd-numbered days. Assuming a non-leap year, is this fair?</li>

<li>The time is now 12:15. What is the angle between the minute hand and the hour hand? (Hard mode: The time is now 2:35, and you must do the calculations entirely in your head.)</li>

<li>You have 8 marbles, identical in size and colour. One of them is very slightly heavier, all the rest weigh the same. What is the minimum number of weighings on a balance-scale that is needed to figure out which marble is the heavy one, with certainty?</li>

<li>People are randomly picked from a typical population, and their birthdays noted. Are there any dates or months which you expect to have below/above average rate of birthdays? What is the probability that a random person has their birthday on a specific date (e.g. March 17th)? What is the probability that three random people share the same birthday?</li>

<li>The battery of an analogue dock mounted on the wall is almost dead. The second hand is twitching every second, but not moving around. What number is the second hand pointing to?</li>

<li>Three adventurous friends are travelling on foot, and have reached the edge of the desert. They want to cross this desert, but do not know how far away the opposite edge of the desert is. There is a lake at the edge of the desert, and it is reasonable to assume that there is a water source on the opposite edge of the desert, too. The party has many water containers with them. Each member of the party can carry 10 litres of water, needs to drink a litre per day, and can walk 10 km per day. The water containers cannot survive being left unattended. While ensuring survival if the opposite edge is not found, how far can the party explore 12 days? 16days? How long would it take to explore 110km, while ensuring survival? With infinite patience and infinite lifespans, can the friends explore forever?</li>

<li>You have two genetically modified eggs that are supposed to be unbreakable, but you know that they are breakable if you drop them from high enough. With a building with 100 floors, how do you determine what floor they will break using the least number of steps?</li>

<li>Cannibals have captured 4 mathematicians, and will eat them! But these cannibals are sporting, and will give the mathematicians a single chance to save themselves. The cannibals bring a large bag with 7 hats, 4 white, 3 black. Then they tie up the mathematicians very securely in a row. Each mathematician can see what is ahead, but not what is above or behind. A hat is taken from the bag, and placed on each mathematician's head, without that mathematician being able to see it. Since they are in a row, the last mathematician can see the three hats ahead, the next mathematician can see two hats, the next can see one hat, and the mathematician who is first in line can see no hats at all. The rules are simple: Any mathematician who figures out the colour of their hat can say the colour, but saying anything else at all will lead to all four being eaten. If just one mathematician figures out the colour of their hat, all four are free. An hour passes, and no one says a thing. Then another hour. And a third hour of silence. Then, after four hours, the FIRST mathematician in line (who can see nothing) figures it out! What colour was the hat, and how did that mathematician figure it out?</li>

<li>You are running a small book store with a membership program, and want to track sales. Name the classes and methods that you would use for this.</li>

<li>A spaceship needs to fire a laser to hit another laser being fired from earth, in mid-air. You cannot set a preset/specific time for firing due to cloudy weather, so it is play by ear. Communication is via satellite internet, with a variable -1-3 second communication lag. How do you synchronize the lasers' firing times?</li>

<li>People want to play a card game with real-life collectible cards, but online vs players on other continents using webcams. What cheating methods do you foresee? Now would you set up the game/cards/system to be cheat-proof?</li>

<li>You are taken prisoner before you can arrange a code with your family. To torture you, you get to choose tomorrow's winning lottery numbers, and you get to email your family, but your email is proofread (and censored if needed) by a bunch of smart people. Now do you get the numbers out?
(Questions 1-12 have optimum/exact answers. Questions 13-14 have multiple comet answers. Questions 15-16 are open ended. Nearly all of these questions come from the internet. Thanks internet)</li>

<h3 id="howtoguide">HOW-TO Guide</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use git and an external website to push on:</strong></p>

<p>Learn to use git and commit early and often. Optionally, use a website to push your work to (such as GitHub). The most important thing is to build a portfolio.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Understand the problem:</strong></p>

<p>Do your own research. It's an incredibly useful skill which can be applied to and can be applied to anything else.
If a problem seems difficult, good! Draw it out, write it out, do whatever you need to do to solve it.
If the problem you're solving is too easy, brainstorm and try adding additional functionality. Try combining it with other ideas to make your software more challenging.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>

<p>Take the language you're most familiar with to start your project. If the problem is too easy, pick a language you've never used. Don't be afraid to write awful code and don't worry about the best implementation. Get a working implementation first, then refactor and clean it up.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Test:</strong></p>

<p>Write test cases for your program. Get used to thinking about how you can break your software. Find problems, bugs, and fix them. Repeat over and over again and document it. Throw it together in your portfolio(don't forget to commit!).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Re-Implement:</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have something together with lots of documentation and experience, try a different language and try to match it as closely as possible to your first implementation. Add features, try new techniques, new styles. Go crazy!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Don't stop learning:</strong></p>

<p>Now that you've gotten this far, don't stop trying to challenge yourself. Keep a portfolio/blog/diary and keep adding to it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>

<p>{Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, Google}</p>

<p>Seriously, this is all you'll ever need. If you aren't getting results, you aren't doing your research properly. With these three websites, you'll find your answers. If they don't exist, make a thread. By doing so, you help other people out too!</p>

<p>Remember: If you make a new topic for a new problem anywhere, write down the solution if someone PM'd you. It helps people a lot and encourages them to do the same.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Literature:</strong></p>

<p><em>Knuth:</em> The Art of Computer Programming</p>

<p><em>Siena:</em> The Algorithm Design Manual</p>

<p><em>Carmen et al:</em> Introduction to Algorithms</p>

<p><em>Russel:</em> Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</p>
