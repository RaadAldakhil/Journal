# Introduction
This journal was a book that was written by hand and has now been converted to markdown to be accessed from everywhere and allow adding and removing on the go rather than having to wait until I reach the book back home and add any new entries by hand on paper.

Despite my preference for paper and book formats, I believe having the content on Github in a markdown format will prove useful for scaling in the future and it will not be limited by collaborators (namely, just myself), nor by physical limits of page count or the book being damaged or becomes otherwise rendered unreadable.
