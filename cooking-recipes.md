### Fluffy Rice
1. **Boil water and add salt**
Pour water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil. Mix 1 teaspoon salt into the water.
2. **Pour in rice**
Add it to the boiling water.
3. **Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice**
Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky.
4. **Cover the pot and simmer**
Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.
5. **Fluff rice with a fork**
Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. And after you've cooked up your perfect rice, might we suggest some chili to go with it?

**Tip:** Don’t uncover the saucepan or stir the rice during cooking. If it’s done before you’re ready to serve it, place a folded towel over the saucepan, replace the lid, and set aside. The towel will absorb excess moisture and condensation, helping prevent overcooked and mushy rice.

### Cheddar Cheese Puffs
#### Ingredients
* 1 stick butter (8 Tbsp or 4 ounces)
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 4 large eggs
* 1 cup (4 ounces) grated sharp cheddar cheese
* 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme (or rosemary)
* Freshly ground pepper
#### Method
1. Boil the water, butter, salt: In a medium sized saucepan, add the water, butter, and salt, and bring to a boil over high heat.
2. Add the flour and stir: Reduce the heat to medium and add the flour all at once. Stir rapidly. The mixture will form a dough ball that will pull away from the sides of the pan. It helps to use a wooden spoon to stir as the dough will be rather thick. Continue to cook for a couple minutes.
3. Let cool a couple minutes, then add eggs, one at a time: Remove the pan from the heat and let cool for a couple of minutes. Stir so that the dough cools more evenly. You want the dough to be warm, just not so hot that when you start adding eggs they cook as they hit the dough.

Add the eggs one at a time, stirring after each addition until the eggs are incorporated into the dough. (Do this part in a mixer if you want, or by hand with a wooden spoon.) The dough should become rather creamy.
4. Stir in the grated cheese, thyme, and a few grinds of pepper.
5. Scoop spoonfuls onto lined baking sheet: Heat oven to 425°F. Spoon out small balls (about a heaping tablespoon) of the dough onto a silicone or parchment lined baking sheet, with at least an inch separating the spoonfuls.
6. Bake: Place in oven and cook for 10 minutes at 425°F. Lower heat to 350°F and cook for another 15-20 minutes, until puffed up and lightly golden.

### Bacon and Herbs Creamy Mashed Potatoes

* 2 Tbsp butter
* 2 Tbsp bacon grease

5. Drain water out of the potatoes.

### Nutella Pancake with Strawberries
#### Ingredients
**FOR THE BASIC PANCAKE MIXTURE**
* 110 grams plain flour
* 1 pinch of salt
* 2 eggs
* 200 millilitres milk
* 75 millilitres water (mix with the milk)
* 50 grams butter
**FOR THE TOPPING**
* nutella
* whipping cream (whisked until stiff)
* strawberries (cut in half)
#### Method
1. Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl so the flour gets a airing. Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs, incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so.
2. Next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking (don't worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream.
3. Now melt the 50g of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake.
4. Now, get the pan really hot, then turn the heat to medium. Make a test pancake first to see if you're using the right amount of batter. Flip pancake when gold.
**Once you're ready to serve, add the topping as follows:**
1. Spread each pancake with a generous amount of Nutella, spoon the whipped cream in a long line down the middle and add the strawberries on top then fold the sides of the pancake to the middle.
2. Best served on slightly warm pancakes (not too hot or the cream will melt)
